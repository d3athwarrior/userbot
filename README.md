# Project

A modular Telegram userbot running on Python 3.8+ with an sqlalchemy database. Based on RaphielGang's [Paperplane](https://github.com/RaphielGang/Telegram-UserBot") Telegram userbot along with few picked and self written extras.

## How To Host

You can try to deploy it using Heroku or the likes but I don't guarantee whether or not this will work.
